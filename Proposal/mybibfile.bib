@article{HakutaKenji2000HLDI,
abstract = {One of the most commonly asked questions about the education of language minority students is how long they need special services, such as English-as-a-Second-Language (ESL) and bilingual education. Under the U. S. Supreme Court’s interpretation of the Civil Rights Act in Lau v. Nichols (1974), local school districts and states have an obligation to provide appropriate services to limited-English-proficient students (in California now referred to as EL or English learner students), but policy makers have long debated setting time limits for students to receive such services. The purpose of this paper is to pull together findings that directly address this question. This study reports on data from four different school districts to draw conclusions on how long it takes students to develop oral and academic English proficiency. Academic English proficiency refers to the ability to use language in academic contexts, which is particularly important for long-term success in school. Two of the data sets are from two school districts in the San Francisco Bay Area and the other two are based on summary data from reports by researchers in Canada. The data were used to analyze various forms of English proficiency as a function of length of exposure to English. The clear conclusion emerging from these data sets is that even in two California districts that are considered the most successful in teaching English to LEP students, oral proficiency takes 3 to 5 years to develop, and academic English proficiency can take 4 to 7 years. The data from the two school districts in Canada offer corroboration. Indeed, these estimates of the time it takes may be underestimates, because only students who remained the same district since kindergarten were included. While critics of bilingual education have claimed that use of the native language delays the acquisition of English (a claim that is without foundation in the academic literature on bilingualism), it is worth noting that only one of the three districts offered bilingual education. The analysis also revealed continuing and widening gap between EL students and native English speakers. The gap illustrates the daunting task facing these students, who not only have to acquire oral and academic English, but also have to keep pace with native English speakers, who continue to develop their language skills. It may simply not be possible, within the constraints of the time available in regular formal school hours, to offer efficient instruction that would enable the EL students to catch up with the rest. Alternatives such as special summer and after-school programs may be needed. The results suggest that policies that assume rapid acquisition of English – the extreme case being Proposition 227 that explicitly calls for “sheltered English immersion during a temporary transition period not normally intended to exceed one year” – are wildly unrealistic. A much more sensible policy would be one that sets aside the entire spectrum of the elementary grades as the realistic range within which English acquisition is accomplished, and plans a balanced curriculum that pays attention not just to English, but to the full array of academic needs of the students.},

@misc{AnandSupreet2018HLDI,
abstract = {English Learners (ELs) constitute one of the fastest growing student populations enrolled in K–12 schools. One important factor influencing the academic achievement of ELs is attaining English language proficiency (ELP). Once ELs attain ELP, they are reclassified as English proficient. In practice, exiting or reclassify ELs indicates that they no longer need or receive specialized language supports or regular monitoring using ELP assessments. Reclassification is a high-stakes decision. A change from an EL to a non-EL status may impact state and federal funding. Some federal and state funds are allocated based on the per-pupil count of ELs enrolled in a school district. Understanding the relationships between reclassification policies, reclassification rates, and reclassified student outcomes is necessary to make decisions about resources and expectations for ELs. This study explored the population of ELs in one state and addressed the following research questions: 1. How long does it take ELs to be reclassified as English proficient based on the criteria established by the New Mexico Public Education Department (NMPED)? 2. Does the probability of reclassification vary by grade cluster when first enrolled in the state’s public schools? 3. How do select individual student-level and family-level characteristics impact the probability of reclassification for students in the same...},

The numbers range from 27,000 lemmas for the lowest 5% to 52,000 for the highest 5%. Between the ages of 20 and 60, the average person learns 6,000 extra lemmas or about one new lemma every two days. The knowledge of the words can be as shallow as knowing that the word exists. In addition, people learn tens of thousands of inflected forms and proper nouns (names), which account for the substantially high numbers of ‘words known’ mentioned in other publications.</p>},

There have been internationally dominant languages before religious languages like Hebrew, Greek, and Latin, as well as Sanskrit and Koranic Arabic and politico-cultural languages, often linked to the religious cultures with which they propagate: Greek and Latin again, French, and (in the 20th century until the fall of Communism) Russian. In the last years of the 20th century English has established an unprecedentedly powerful position, which has even grown stronger since the more circumspect evaluation of its position by McCrum et al. 1986. The extent of its quantitative and qualitative domination of international geopolitics, science, commerce, communications, technology, politics, and consumer culture is evident in journals like , , and .

	abstract="KALAKA-3 is a speech database specifically designed for the development and evaluation of Spoken Language Recognition (SLR) systems. The database provides TV broadcast speech for training, and audio data extracted from YouTube videos for tuning and testing. The database was created to support the Albayzin 2012 Language Recognition Evaluation (LRE), which featured two language recognition tasks, both dealing with European languages. The first one involved six target languages (Basque, Catalan, English, Galician, Portuguese and Spanish) for which there was plenty of training data, whereas the second one involved four target languages (French, German, Greek and Italian) for which no training data was provided. This second task tried to simulate the use case of low resource languages. Two separate sets of YouTube audio files were provided to test the performance of language recognition systems on both tasks. To allow open-set tests, these datasets included speech in 11 additional (Out-Of-Set) European languages. In this paper, we first discuss the design issues considered when creating the database and describe the data collection procedure. Then, we present the results attained in the Albayzin 2012 LRE, along with the performance of state-of-the-art systems on the four evaluation tracks defined on the database. Both series of results demonstrate the usefulness of KALAKA-3 as a challenging benchmark for the advancement of SLR technology. As far as we know, this is the first database specifically designed to benchmark SLR technology on YouTube audios.",
